# Overview #
This repo is intended to practice the steps found in the [Go getting started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started "Golang docs") documentation. It's a simple project for practicing the basics, such as module creation, error handling, and compiling/running a simple Go application.

I have been practicing these steps in a [Golang Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang "Docker Hub Golang Image") for funzies as well.
